# Welcome on board ☠️

As a one of our new cabin boys we have some tests for you to show us what a pirate can become out of you. Like a real pirate you must find your way by yourselve sometimes. We give you only some little hints to get the 🔑 to our pirate ship.

## What you need

You need some basic knowledge about

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Time frame

You have exact one week after you recived this test. When you are not finish with all tasks, no worry.

## 1. Hotel list

We need for our next trip with the whole ☠️-crew a hotel and what we get from our backend-🐵 was only [this](http://fake-hotel-api.herokuapp.com/).

Your task is now to present us the hotels, that we can choose the right one for our next trip. To make it easier for us to find the right hotel, we want to have a filter for hotel ⭐ (stars) and hotel 💰 (price).

**Acceptance Criterias:**

* We are modern pirates and love to navigate with our mobile devices too. Please optimize your presentation on all modern devices
* On our trips we want to have it more comfortable and the default hotel list should have minimum 3 ⭐.
* You will find a lot of data and informations for one hotel. Show us you what you think is really important to present.
* Pirates love to share their knowledge! Please find a way to show for every hotel also the reviews, that we know what other pirates thing about the hotel.

**Bonus (extra chance for our pirate ship 🔑):**
Write some tests (integration, unit or e2e) which you find useful for your code. Use every test framework which you want.

**Optional:**
Did you miss something in our hotel API? Something what is really needed or you think is important to have before start with the design or frontend? Please write down your thoughts in a simple list with short statements that we can discuss these point together later.

### Technical Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Please install Node.js globally

### Tech Stack

Please use our starter kit what we prepared for you. __Use plain JavaScript and no CSS framework!__ But you are free to install npm packages which you think is needed to solve the test in the best way.

To start you must only install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Now you can start developing with

```bash
npm start
```

To build your final project call

```bash
npm run build
```

### Design

We have no requirements for design. No colors, no mockups, nothing. Please feel free to inspire us with everything you think this list of hotels needs to be perfect in case of UX and UI.

### Product Requirements

Please create a ZIP file and include every asset (images, data files,... [no node_modules folder please]) which we need to run the presentation on local. Your final code should run without any error in following desktop browser:

* Chrome(version >=76)
* Safari (version >= 12)
* Firefox (version >= 69)

And on the following mobile browser (only when you have real test devices):

* iOS Safari (version >= 12)
* Samsung Internet (version >= 9)
* Chrome for Android (version >= 76)

For the first mobile tests without real devices you can run your code in chrome devtools [device-mode](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode). Here, please run it at minimum for the following devices:

* Galaxy S5
* IPhone 6/7/8
* Pixel 2
* IPhoen X
* IPad

## 2. The Flight

To get to our hotel we also need a flight. But here our backend-🐵 has no idea how he can start with the development.

Your second task is to explain our backend-🐵 what you need from him as a data structure for an API endpoint.

Here you are completly free how the data structure should look like and which format it should have. Think about what you need to show us also a flight list where we can search flight to our hotel.

Please describe with your own words in a text what you need and give us a short example with dummy data how your data structure will look like. See this text as a briefing for a KickOff meeting that all departments can sit together and talk about the next steps.
